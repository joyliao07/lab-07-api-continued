**Author**: Joyce Liao and Derrick Hwang
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)


## Overview
We build a server with JS to take a user's request of a location, send the request to Google's backend servers, obtain results from Google backend server, and then respond to the user. In this lab, we extend the API to obtian information from Dark Sky, Yelp and the Movie DB. 


## Getting Started
The user must log onto the website, put in their location request and hit submit button.


## Architecture
We use JavaScript, npm.js, Node.js, Express.js, Superagent, Dotenv and Google's backend server to complete this middle server.
